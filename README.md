# bioinformatics-on-cloud

The collection of bioinformatics tools and sample codes.

## SAM tools

- [Sequence Alignment/Map Tools]
- A software package for processing short DNA sequence read alignments in the SAM, BAM and CRAM formats including sorting, merging, indexing, converting and many more.
- Programming language: C
- 📕 [Sample code](https://github.com/jingwora/bioinformatics-on-cloud/blob/main/tools/SAMtools/SAMtools_v-01.ipynb)

## Pysam

- a Python package for reading and manipulating DNA sequence files.
- Lightweight wrapper of the htslib C-API
- SAM/BAM/VCF/BCF/BED/GFF/GTF/FASTA/FASTQ
- Programming language: Python
- 📕 [Sample code](https://github.com/jingwora/bioinformatics-on-cloud/blob/main/tools/pysam/pysam_v-01.ipynb)

## tsinfer (tskit)

- [Tree Sequence infer]
- To infer succinct tree sequences from observed genetic variation data, an efficient way of representing the correlated genealogies that describe the ancestry of many species.

- 📕 [Sample code](https://github.com/jingwora/bioinformatics-on-cloud/blob/main/tools/tsinfer/Tskit-tsinfer_v-01.ipynb)

## msprime (tskit)

- A population genetics simulator based on tskit.
- It can simulate random ancestral histories for a sample of individuals (consistent with a given demographic model) under a range of different models and evolutionary processes.

- 📕 [Sample code](https://github.com/jingwora/bioinformatics-on-cloud/blob/main/tools/msprime/msprime_v-01.ipynb)

## BWA

- [Burrow-Wheeler Aligner]
- A software package for mapping DNA sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome.
- It consists of three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM.
- 📕 [Sample code](https://github.com/jingwora/bioinformatics-on-cloud/blob/main/tools/bwa/bwa_v-02-03.ipynb)
