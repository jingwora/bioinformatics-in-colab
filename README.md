# Bioinformatics-Tools

The collection of bioinformatics tools and sample codes.

## SAM tools

- [Sequence Alignment/Map Tools]
- A software package for processing short DNA sequence read alignments in the SAM, BAM and CRAM formats including sorting, merging, indexing, converting and many more.

## tsinfer (tskit)

- [Tree Sequence infer]
- To infer succinct tree sequences from observed genetic variation data, an efficient way of representing the correlated genealogies that describe the ancestry of many species.

## msprime (tskit)

- A population genetics simulator based on tskit.
- It can simulate random ancestral histories for a sample of individuals (consistent with a given demographic model) under a range of different models and evolutionary processes.
